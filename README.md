# MCDA4ArcMap

This add-in for the ArcMap geographic information system (GIS) offers multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and visualization functions for vector data. The MCDA process is highly interactive and the results can be processed within ArcMap.

PLEASE NOTE THE [DISCLAIMER BELOW](https://github.com/steffanv/mcda4arcmap/blob/master/README.md#disclaimer) AND THE STIPULATIONS UNDER THE [LICENSE TAB](LICENCE).

## Features
The add-in supports the following MCDA methods:

- Weighted Linear Combination (WLC)
- Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA)
- Locally Weighted Linear Combination (LWLC)

The LWLC method includes the following neighborhood definitions:

- Queen
- Rook
- Distance
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Automatic (increases KNN until the result can be calculated)

Additional add-in features include:

- Maximum-score standardization procedure
- Score-range standardization procedure
- CSV export of the result table and parameters
- Classified and unclassed choropleth maps with diverging colour scheme
- Three modi to define the map rendering frequency

## Limitations

- Only polygon geometry is supported
- Criterion values must be numeric
- Rook contiguity for large data sets (> 1,000 polygons) is slow (several minutes processing time)
- Sessions are not persistent, MCDA results are lost when MCDA4ArcMap is closed - use right-click | Data | Export to save map layer containing results

## System Requirements

- Developed for ArcMap 10.1, ArcMap 10.2 or later and the .Net Framework 4.0 or later
- Download should appear as "ESRI AddIn File" - if ArcMap runs, this add-in will also work! Downloads can be found in the [releases section](https://github.com/steffanv/mcda4arcmap/releases)
